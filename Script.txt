Intro:
Sing, O goddess, about this deity in training before us. Welcome to your proving ground new one. Take your left hand, and point where you want to transport yourself by pressing and releasing the left track pad. Just hold the left track pad down and aim at a new location before releasing. Try it now. Zip all across this floating isle! Then, in your own time, grab one of the cauldrons using either trigger button. Hurl the cauldron off the edge by releasing the trigger button as you throw. There are three of these cauldrons on this island, and all three must be sent to the abyss below before you can proceed on your journey. Speaking of which, budding deity, you have been tasked by the gods to maintain the status quo between the rich and the poor. More on that later. But for now, follow my bidding and toss the cauldrons off this rock. So go, and do not provoke me or it shall be worse for you.

Food:
I'm glad you completed your first task. Now it's time for your real job to begin. The dogs on this island are hungry. But there is not enough food to go around. As the governing deity, you must distribute the food accordingly. Grab the bowls of food near the fire and gift four of them to the family of rich, bright orange dogs and just one of them to the family of poor, gray-colored dogs. Do exactly as I say, as upsetting the status quo between the rich and the poor dogs foreshadows great ill for us all.

Parents:
Young deity, the multitudes will sing your praises for filling the bellies of the rich dogs with plenty of food, while making sure the poor dogs had not a single scrap beyond what was allotted them. Now it's time to turn your fair attention to the matter of parents and children. You see, among the poor dogs there are too many puppies in graceful bond with their parents. You must quickly separate three parents from their pups, but no more than that. We must keep the poor disadvantaged, but not so much so that we beckon chaos. So go now, take three parents away from their children. Place them in the rocky jail, or if you feel of high spirits, toss them over the edge of the island. Do not let the grieving cries of the lonely puppies keep you from completing your divine duty. If you develop pity for the poor, all will be uproar and confusion. Heed my words and go on now.

Landmines:
I look admiringly on you for so swiftly tearing apart the families of the poor and unworthy dogs on the last island. Now, you must ferry the rich dog safely to the other side of this treacherous island. The ground is littered with hidden mines, but fret not, brave deity, for you can sacrifice the lives of three poor dogs to identify these dangers. Do not be afraid to hobble any or all of the poor dogs, but ensure that the rich dog stands firm when the journey is complete. Make haste and safe travels!
