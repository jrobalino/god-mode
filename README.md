This repo contains my Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree capstone project. The experience casts players as a deity in charge of maintaining the status quo between a set of rich and poor dogs. Without pity, players must ration food unevenly, separate puppies from their parents, and risk the lives of poor dogs. Ultimately, players must sacrifice the souls of the poor dogs in order to bless the rich dogs. In return, players receive adoring worship from those that benefit. But is maintaining the status quo truly the only option?

## List of Achievements

The project satisfies the following achievements per the Udacity project rubric:

### Fundamentals: 500 points

- **Scale Achievement**—The player is a deity of human size relative to the dogs and the environment.
- **Animation Achievement**—The dogs contain idle, bark, run, and jump animations. The animations states are triggered via script.
- **Lighting Achievement**—Every scene has a combination of realtime directional lights and baked lights (area, point, or spotlight).
- **Locomotion Achievement**—The player can teleport around the environment using the left trackpad.
- **Empathy Achievement**—As a deity tasked with preserving the status quo, the player is forced to play favorites with one group of dogs while being cruel to another group of dogs. Players must distribute food in unequal amounts, separate puppies from their parents, guide dogs through an active minefield, and forsake the souls of the unfortunate. Most players should experience a conflict of the heart, wanting to complete the instructions they are given but feeling bad for the less fortunate dogs.

### Completeness: 750 points

- **Gamification Achievement**—The player can unlock the following achievements throughout the game:

| Achievement | Level | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Top Chef | Food | Add mushrooms to the poor table. |
| Gluttony | Food | Add mushrooms to the rich table. |
| Adoption | Parents | Take a poor puppy to the top island where the rich dogs are. |
| Minesweeper | Landmine | Cross the minefield without losing a single dog. |
| Sharpshooter | Hellfire | Shoot four dogs into the hell portals without missing. |
| Favorite Uncle | Hellfire | Send the three puppies to heaven. |

- **Alternative Storyline Achievement**—In the last level, the player can choose whether to maintain the status quo. By casting the three puppies into hell and then sending the unlocked treasure chest to heaven, the player maintains the status quo and the ending shows the player being worshipped by the rich dogs. However, if the player casts the treasure chest (either closed or opened) into hell instead, then the rich dogs are not blessed with power, wealth, and good fortune. The ending shows the player worshipped by the poor dogs, alongside a large bowl of food ready to distribute to the masses.
- **3D Modeling Achievement**—I modeled the dog bowl in Blender.

### Challenges: 500 points
